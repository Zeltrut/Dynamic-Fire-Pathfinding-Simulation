# Dynamic-Fire-Pathfinding-Simulation
Our project simulates a building on fire, with available paths dynamically altered. We will compare A* as an informed search and BFS as a uniform baseline to see which finds a better path from start to goal as the grid changes. PyGame-based is used for visualization to show different danger levels, fire intensity, and agent movement. We’ll evaluate each algorithm's performance through multiple simulations using random seeds, measuring success rate, number of steps, and danger exposure to determine which method adapts better to a dynamic environment.
